A lightweight and efficient lane detection model designed for real-time performance on autonomous driving and ADAS platforms. This model leverages **Conv-BatchNorm-GELU-Attention (CBGA)** modules and an **auxiliary segmentation branch** to achieve a superior balance between accuracy, speed, and model size.

Trained on the **TuSimple** lane detection dataset, CBGA-LaneNet demonstrates high accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions such as shadows, occlusions, and poor lighting.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for low-latency inference, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices and embedded automotive hardware.
*   **Lightweight & Efficient**: A small parameter footprint achieved through the use of Ghost convolutions in the segmentation head, minimizing resource requirements.
*   **High Robustness**: Excels in challenging scenarios including:
    *   Heavy shadows and changing lighting.
    *   Partial lane occlusions.
    *   Curved roads and complex lane markings.
    *   Poor visibility conditions.
*   **Advanced Architecture**:
    *   **CBGA Blocks**: Custom blocks combining Convolution, BatchNorm, GELU activation, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention for enhanced feature discriminability.
    *   **Attention Mechanism**: SE attention allows the model to adaptively prioritize the most relevant features for lane detection.
*   **Auxiliary Training for Improved Accuracy**: An auxiliary segmentation branch is used during training to improve gradient flow and lane continuity, without adding any overhead to the final inference model.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model's architecture is designed for efficiency and accuracy. It consists of the following key components:

1.  **Backbone (Feature Extractor)**: A ResNet-based backbone is used for robust initial feature extraction from the input image.

2.  **CBGA Blocks**: The core of the model. These blocks process the features from the backbone.
    ```
    Input -> Conv2D -> BatchNorm -> GELU Activation -> Squeeze-and-Excitation -> Output
    ```
    The SE Attention module helps the network focus on subtle yet crucial lane features while suppressing irrelevant background noise.

3.  **Main Segmentation Head**: This head predicts the final lane markings. It utilizes lightweight **Ghost convolutions** to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost (FLOPs) without sacrificing performance.

4.  **Auxiliary Segmentation Branch (Training Only)**: This branch is attached to an intermediate layer of the network during training. It provides an additional supervision signal, which helps combat vanishing gradients and encourages the model to learn more representative features early on. It is detached before deployment, ensuring no impact on inference speed.
